				<h2>States Without High Tax</h2>
				<p style="line-height: 190%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states like Texas have a low tax rate and don't even have a income tax, Yet they still have everything New york has without the high taxes on people. The main reason for this is because New York is a progressive state which means that we get taxed of from how much we earn.
